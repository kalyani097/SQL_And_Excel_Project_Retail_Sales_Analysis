# SQL_And_Excel_Project_Retail_Sales_Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to uncover key insights that can help in understanding customer behavior, sales trends, and popular products. The project utilizes **SQL** for data querying and analysis, and **Excel** for creating visual dashboards to present the findings. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help in making data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies and customer engagement.


## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing retail sales information. The analysis is divided into two main parts:

1. **SQL Data Analysis**: Various SQL queries are used to extract insights such as customer demographics, popular products, payment methods, and seasonal trends.
2. **Excel Dashboard**: The insights derived from the SQL analysis are visualized using an Excel dashboard, which provides a comprehensive view of the sales data through charts and tables.


## Key Insights
### 1. **Customer Demographics**
   - The ratio of male to female customers is approximately **68:32**.
   - The most served age group is **46-59 years**.

### 2. **Popular Products and Categories**
   - The most popular category and items purchased were identified.
   - The most purchased item by the age group **46-59** was determined.

### 3. **Sales Trends**
   - The season with the most purchases was identified.
   - The most popular payment method and shipping type were analyzed.

### 4. **Payment Methods**
   - The most common payment method used by the most popular age group (**46-59**) was identified.


## SQL Queries
The SQL queries used in this project include:
- Calculating the ratio of male to female customers.
- Identifying the most served age group.
- Determining the most and least popular categories.
